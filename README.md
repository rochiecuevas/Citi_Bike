*Citi Bike in New York City* is a page which visualises Citi Bike ridership data from 2018. The dashboards contain information about the demographics of Citi Bike users, the number of trips on any given day, and the traffic flow in different Citi Bike stations in the Big Apple.

Creating the dashboards involved extracting information from Citi Bike's publicly available [data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) and plotting these with the use of [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/). 

To see how the visualisation was created, head over to the project [wiki](https://github.com/rochiecuevas/Citi_Bike/wiki) page. And to see the deployed product, head over to [Citi Bike in New York City](https://rochiecuevas.github.io/Citi_Bike/).
